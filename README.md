## Fonts

* Roboto
Christian Robertson
Apache License, version 2.0

Roboto has a dual nature. It has a mechanical skeleton and the forms are largely geometric. At the same time, the font features friendly and open curves. While some grotesks distort their letterforms to force a rigid rhythm, Roboto doesn’t compromise, allowing letters to be settled into their natural width. This makes for a more natural reading rhythm more commonly found in humanist and serif types.

* Economica

SIL Open Font License, 1.1

Economica is the first digital typeface created in Montevideo, Uruguay, to be distributed internationally. The development of the typeface took most of 2007 and received the assistance of type design colleagues from all over Latin America.

Economica has four basic styles: Regular, Bold, Italic and Bold Italic. It includes a comprehensive character set that lets you work with diverse European languages.

This typeface family was designed for the output of inkjet printers. It was inspired by the concept of saving space in publishing texts without loss of height. This means it is a very condensed type.

The visual advantage of Economica is that accomplishes this horizontal compression while keeping a strong personality. It is not a typical, neutral, sans serif. The open forms and tendency towards flattened curves allow it to be used in very small spaces while retaining high legibility.

* Open Sans
Steve Matteson
Apache License, version 2.0

Open Sans is a humanist sans serif typeface designed by Steve Matteson, Type Director of Ascender Corp. This version contains the complete 897 character set, which includes the standard ISO Latin 1, Latin CE, Greek and Cyrillic character sets. Open Sans was designed with an upright stress, open forms and a neutral, yet friendly appearance. It was optimized for print, web, and mobile interfaces, and has excellent legibility characteristics in its letterforms.
